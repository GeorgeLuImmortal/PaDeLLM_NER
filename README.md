# PaDeLLM-NER: Parallel Decoding in Large Language Models for Named Entity Recognition

This repository is an official implementation based on paper [PaDeLLM-NER: Parallel Decoding in Large Language Models for Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04838)

# Training

Since it is easy to re-implement the training procedure based on the paper, we will not provide the training code, instead, we provide the trained models online for replicate purpose.

All model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/JinghuiLuAstronaut

with names PaDeLLM_{model}_{model_size}_{dataset}
